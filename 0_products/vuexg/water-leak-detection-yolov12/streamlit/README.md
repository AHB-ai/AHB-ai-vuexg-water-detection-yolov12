# Water Leak Detection App

This Streamlit application uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models to identify objects in images and videos, with a focus on a custom model trained for water leak detection.

Developed by [AHB.ai](https://www.ahb.ai).

## Features

*   **Image Detection:** Upload an image (JPG, JPEG, PNG) for object detection.
*   **Video Detection:** Upload a video (MP4, AVI, MOV, WEBM) for frame-by-frame object detection.
*   **Example Inputs:** Use provided example images for quick testing.
*   **Model Selection:** Choose between a custom water leak detection model and standard YOLOv12 models (nano to xlarge).
*   **Adjustable Settings:** Configure inference image size and confidence threshold via the sidebar.
*   **Real-time Preview:** View video processing progress and periodic frame previews.
*   **Save Processed Video:** Download the video with detection overlays after processing is complete.
*   **Clean UI:** User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
*   **Customizable:** Easily update model paths and example images.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.11+
*   Packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
    *   `streamlit`
    *   `opencv-python-headless`
    *   `numpy`
    *   `ultralytics`
    *   `Pillow`

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url> # Or download and extract the code
    cd your_project_directory
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Place Assets:**
    *   Put your logo file named `logo.png` inside the `assets/` directory.
    *   Place your custom YOLO model (e.g., `water_leak.pt`) inside the `models/` directory. The code defaults to `models/water_leak.pt`. If your model name or location differs, update the `DEFAULT_CUSTOM_MODEL_PATH` constant in `app.py`.
    *   Place your example images (e.g., `example1.jpg`, `example2.jpg`) inside the `examples/` directory. Update the `EXAMPLE_IMAGES` dictionary in `app.py` if your filenames differ.

4.  **Download Standard YOLO Models (if needed):**
    The `ultralytics` library will automatically download the standard YOLOv12 models (`yolov12n.pt`, `yolov12s.pt`, etc.) the first time they are selected, provided you have an internet connection.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  The application will open in your default web browser.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Configure Settings (Sidebar):**
    *   **Select Model:** Choose the detection model to use. The "Custom" model is specific to water leaks. Standard YOLO models detect common objects.
    *   **Image Size:** Adjust the image size for detection. Larger sizes might improve accuracy for small objects but increase processing time.
    *   **Confidence Threshold:** Set the minimum confidence score for a detection to be displayed. Lower values show more detections, potentially including false positives.
    *   **Input Type:** Select whether you want to process an "Image" or a "Video".

2.  **Provide Input (Main Area - Left Column):**
    *   **Image:** Click "Upload an image" or select one of the example images from the dropdown.
    *   **Video:** Click "Upload a video". The original video will be displayed once uploaded.

3.  **Start Detection:**
    *   Click the "âš¡ Detect Objects" button.

4.  **View Results (Main Area - Right Column):**
    *   **Image:** The original image appears in the left column (if uploaded/selected), and the image with detection bounding boxes appears in the right column.
    *   **Video:** Processing progress is shown. A preview frame updates periodically. Once finished, the processed video with detections appears in the right column.

5.  **Save Video:**
    *   If a video was processed successfully, a "ðŸ’¾ Save Processed Video" button will appear below the result video. Click it to download the `.mp4` file to your computer.

6.  **Model Information:**
    *   Below the results, information about the classes detected by the selected model is displayed.

## Notes

*   Video processing can be computationally intensive and may take time, especially for long videos or large models.
*   Ensure the model files (`water_leak.pt`, etc.) and example images are correctly placed in their respective directories (`models/`, `examples/`) or update the paths in `app.py`.
*   Temporary files are created during video processing. The temporary *input* video is deleted automatically after processing. The temporary *processed* video is kept until you download it or potentially start a new video processing task (depending on Streamlit's session behavior).
